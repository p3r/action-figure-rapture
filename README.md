* Emails strings are annoying, keep discussion in the repo and watch the repository (click the eye icon above you freaks).
* Keep the repo clean.


###Reminder these are the ideas floated so far:
* The NSA Shitlist series (Edward Snowden, Bradley 'Chelsea' Manning, Julian Assange?) 
* Revenge of The Nerds series
* Star Wars: Atrocities series     

The current plan of action is to leave aside the Star Wars and Revenge of The Nerds idea and do the NSA Hacker series figures as our first prototypes. 

###The idea being that this series: 
*  Has the least overhead costs.
* Is not subject to the same copyright restrictions as the franchises. This would enable our using a Kickstarter campaign to get attention and demonstrate that we can get some interest and cashflow going. Our Minimal Viable Product at this point would be the kickstarter page.

This series seems to be the one would be fastest/ cheapest to roll out / circumvents the legal issues associated with the other series which we will probably have to be smarter about selling as bootlegs.

In order to move ahead for the NSA Hacker series prototypes we will need about $500 total.

The costs would breakdown as follows:

###Hacker heads: (Custom Head for 12" Figure $88 per head)
