#Meeting Notes 26-01-14
###Attendees:
* Peter
* Nat
* Andrew
* John
* JP 

##Discussion Points
* We will move forward with prototype of Edward Snowden, the other characters will be made digitally (estimated 3-4 weeks to produce).
 This will be used for our kickstarter and pre-order site. 
	* Checkout - sideshowtoy.com to get a sense of how they handle preorders 
	* Example of concept/prototype http://www.bigbadtoystore.com/bbts/product.aspx?product=GG10639&mode=retail
	* Source images to meet thatsmyface requirements http://www.thatsmyface.com/Products/submit-new-face.html

* Get figure body and clothes? (Forgot where we landed on this)

* Plan Google ad campaign to test for interest in the market, i don't know if this includes a PR effort alsoâ€¦ my vote is PR.

* Create a landing page to accept preorders. (need to discuss this more, certain sites charge you a non refundable fee, payment plans etc.,).
sideshowtoy.com is know for having a good preorder and flex pay solution. 

* Focus on sourcing a sculpting/3d artist that can create a mould to take to production assuming that we get some sort of traction with the above,
	* Artist should have experience making action figure heads. A big name in the industry like The Four Horsemen, Ashley Wood, Ron English, or Tara Mcpherson would be preferable.

* I'll setup a bank account under Nerdminer LLC. To keep money in a central spot.
	* Peter recommends that the bank account be setup with Silicon Valley Bank http://www.svb.com/ or Square 1 Bank https://www.square1financial.com/ as suggested by this Quora thread http://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-bank-for-Series-A-startups-in-NYC

* I was voted take lead on the project 

* We need someone to be treasurer ( I think Andrew wanted this position)
	* After brunch in a Hangout with JP, Peter expressed interest in the treasurer position if all of us have about the same amount of experience. Please let him know if you have prior experience. Otherwise we can start with this https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7VQBEwKS1uoelVxcXhSSkh5OWc&usp=sharing

Please add missed notes above.

Om Shanti
